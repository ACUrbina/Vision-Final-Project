# Semi-supervised Video Segmentation.
## Laura Cristina Ruales and Andrea Carolina Urbina

### README:
Video segmentation has been an emerging area in computer vision along the last decades. This area brings together different problems 
of computer vision including object recognition, scenery classification, media editing and many more. This area has been approached 
by semi-supervised and un-supervised algorithms. Although, all the approaches give advantages and can be used in different applications.
We aim to apply a semi-supervised segmentation algorithm to segment a specific given instance along a time sequence inside a video. 
Because, we think that it is the best way to simplify video representation to segment specific objects of interest from the beginning to 
the end of a given sequence
